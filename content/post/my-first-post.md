I'm very excited to make this first post back into blogging through an entirely different platform. Through this blog I would like to share insight on the different projects that I take up, and why I think that they are awesome. The project first I will discuss is this blog. I have been searching , passively,  forever for a platform that would give me enough development power, ease of setup, and cost effective (eh, I'm cheap). Now I think I have finally found it with github pages and hugo. Other projects that I have in the workings are learning DirectX 12, ray tracing, and machine learning so stay tuned and be sure to watch the [front page](/).
